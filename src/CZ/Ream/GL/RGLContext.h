/**
 * @brief OpenGL context data manager.
 *
 * In Ream, each device has a dedicated OpenGL context for every thread that uses it.
 * Although these contexts are created as shared, they do not always share all OpenGL resourcesâ€”
 * such as framebuffers, shader programs, and others, making it difficult for users to allocate
 * and manage their own graphics resources.
 *
 * This class enables users to provide a custom allocator function that creates an instance of a subclass
 * of RGLContextData, which can be populated with any required data members. The instance is automatically created
 * if one does not already exist for the current device/context combination when getData() is called.
 *
 * At allocation time, the EGL context for the corresponding device and thread is made current.
 * The same applies when the destructor of the associated RGLContextData is invoked.
 *
 * Each allocated RGLContextData instance is automatically destroyed under the following conditions:
 * - When its thread terminates
 * - When this manager is destroyed
 * - When you manually call freeData()
